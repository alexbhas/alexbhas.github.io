As the final project for the 'Object Oriented Software Engineering' course, my group was tasked with creating a simulation for the OASIS Pro CES medical therapy device. This device is used to administer Microcurrent Electro Therapy to the user. 

To develop this simulation, we made use of the Qt framework and C++. We designed the user interface using Qt's UI builder and ensured that it accurately represented the device. In order to store the user's preferences and session history, we made use of an SQLite database.

Alongside the implementation was thorough documentation that we had created. This included all possible use cases for the device, as well as UML structural and behavioural diagrams and a traceability matrix that included all of the functions of the device.

You can view the OASIS Pro device here, but our repository is private for academic purposes.
