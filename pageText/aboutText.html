<p>Hello! I'm Alex, a fourth-year computer science student at Carleton University. I am graduating in April 2023 and am currently looking for new graduate positions.</p>
<p>The aspects of computer science that I am most interested in are its potential applications. I have seen firsthand the impact that well-designed websites and software can have on improving different areas of our lives. A long standing goal of mine is to contribute to projects that are accessible and revolve around causes that are important to me.</p>
<P>Some of my interests include: music, working out, photography, astronomy, collecting, and building computers.</P>
